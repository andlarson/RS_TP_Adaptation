# Input:
#    A .inp file defining an Abaqus simulation.
# Functionality:
#    Parses the portion of the .inp file which lists the node numbers and
#       nodal coordinates.
# Return:
#    List of tuples. Each tuple contains: node number, x coord, y coord, z
#       coord.
def parse_nodes(file_name):


# Input: 
#    File containing nodes at absolute path.
# Functionality: 
#    Collects groups of nodes with the same y-coordinates.
# Return:
#    List of tuples. Each tuple contains a y-coordinate and a list of nodes
#       which lie at that y-coordinate.
