Short Term TODO.

1) Add more exotic tool path geometries.

2) Add C++ support for defining some simple stress profiles.

3) Create a small library of examples illustrating current functionality, 
      including BCs in the initial .cae files.

4) Add support for commiting a tool pass. This will include functionality 
      for chaining across MDBs, since one committed tool pass = one MDB.

5) Add support for back calculating stress which caused a particular
      deformation.
