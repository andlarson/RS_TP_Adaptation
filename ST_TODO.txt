Short Term TODO.

1) Make code support simulation chaining.
    1) Map mesh output to geometry.
    2) Map old stress profile to new geometry.
    3) Propagate boundary conditions and account for them if necessary.

2) Pause to map out current code structure and do clean up.

3) Add C++ support for defining some simple stress profiles.

4) Create a small library of examples illustrating current functionality, 
      including BCs in the initial .cae files.

5) Add support for commiting a tool pass. This will include functionality 
      for chaining across MDBs, since one committed tool pass = one MDB.

6) Add support for back calculating stress which caused a particular
      deformation.
