Short Term TODO.

1) Finish adding notion of tool pass commitment.

2) Add more exotic tool path geometries.

3) Add C++ support for defining some simple stress profiles.
   As part of this, account for the case when the user specifies a stress profile
      which is far from equilbirium. 

4) Create a small library of examples illustrating current functionality, 
      including BCs in the initial .cae files.

5) Add support for back calculating stress which caused a particular
      deformation.
