Setup code search / tags ability
Look into tmux functionality to improve tabbing setup.
Write vim tool to fix Python comment formatting automatically.
Compare the deformation which results from geometry change to element deletion.
Build a good debugging setup for making calls into the Abaqus API....
Ensure that the calls into the Abaqus API are isolated into well defined modules
  in the software repo.
Resolve the fact that if the initial residual stress field is far from equilibrium,
  then building the post-cut geometry and allowing relaxation is not equivalent
  to allowing relaxation and then doing material removal.
It feels brittle to assume only a single model with a particular name in an MDB.
  It is probably worthwhile to generalize. I think it's ok to assume a particular
  structure for the MDBs which are handed to us.
It also feels brittle to intermingle the stress equilibration and the machining
  procedures. That is, material removal is really unrelated to a sometimes
  necessary stress equilibration step. Stress equilibration is sometimes necessary
  because the way that a stress field is represented doesn't exactly match
  reality. Material removal is a fundamental procedure which is required during
  the machining process.
