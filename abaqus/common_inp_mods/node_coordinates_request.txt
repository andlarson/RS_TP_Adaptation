** Add the nodal coordinates to the .dat file.
** In a small displacement analysis, these are original coordinates of the
**   nodes (i.e. those of the nodes before any displacements occur).
** In a large displacement analysis, these are the displaced coordinates of
**   the nodes.
** It's not clear what this means in the context of Abaqus, but it appears like
**   we are doing small displacement analysis.
** Also, it appears that this command must go in a static analysis step.
