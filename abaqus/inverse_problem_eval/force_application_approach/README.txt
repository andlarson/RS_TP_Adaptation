This directory contains an experimental setup to test the force application 
  approach to solving the inverse problem.

There are two CAE models present.

One is a bar with a residual stress profile which has a cut through it. The bar
  has been allowed to deform accordingly.

The other is a replica bar with no stress profile. It has an identical cut
  through it. Forces have been applied orthogonal to the revealed cutting surfaces
  in an attempt to induce a deformation which is identical to that observed
  in the bar with a residual stress pattern.

The bar has shape 40 x 10 x 400.
The cut has shape 40 x 50 * 10^(-3) x 10 and is centered in the bar.
