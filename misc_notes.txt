Abaqus Feature objects are almost completely useless. When an Abaqus Feature object
  is created (via a call to PartitionFaceBySketch() for example) it's usually the
  case that some other object is created at the same time (for PartitionFaceBySketch(),
  at least one new Abaqus Face object is created and added to the appropriate
  repository of Abaqus Face objects). It's not uncommon to want to retrieve the 
  Abaqus Face object which was just created. However, it's not possible to do 
  this with just the Abaqus Feature object which was created alongside the 
  Abaqus Face object. The Abaqus Feature object has id and name data members,
  but these can only be used to lookup the Abaqus Feature object itself, not
  the underlying object.
A hack can be done where you monitor the sequence of interest (for example, the
  Abaqus FaceArray object associated with an Abaqus Part object) and if you know
  only a single new Abaqus object is created when the feature creation
  happens, you can extract the new Abaqus object by just extracting the
  last entry in the sequence. This forces you to assume that the new Abaqus object
  is always added as the last entry, and that only a single Abaqus object is
  created.
