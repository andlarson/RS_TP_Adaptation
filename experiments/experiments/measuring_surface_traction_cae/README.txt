The purpose of these experiments is to study the relationship between the stress
    field and the surface tractions which are developed on the surfaces due to
    the stress field. The general setup is to imbue a geometry with an arbitrary
    stress field (which may not satisfy equilibrium), constrain the geometry so
    that deformation cannot happen, and then study the tractions which develop
    on the surfaces of the geometry.

The first question I want to answer is:

    For a constant stress field and arbitrary geometry, is there a straightforward
        way to predict what the tractions on the surfaces are? Does it matter if
        the surfaces are planar or not? Does the geometry matter at all?

    For a non-constant stress field and arbitrary geometry, what calculations need
        to be done to compute the tractions which develop on the surfaces?
