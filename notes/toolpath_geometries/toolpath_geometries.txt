What are the toolpath geometries that we need to represent in simulation?
The answer depends on the G-code for the machine tool we are using. If we cannot
   represent the toolpath geometry in terms of the machine's G-code, we have
   no way of actually doing the cut and therefore there is no reason to simulate
   the cut.


Ok, so what are some example G-code commands?

   Standard features seem to include linear motion and circular interpolation (G0, G1, G2, G3).
   Some machines support more advanced motions. For example, the LinuxCNC system
      appears to support Cubic Splines (G5) and Quadratic Splines (G5.1). The
      FANUC CNC Funciton catalog lists significantly more exotic options. The
      HaasCNC machines seem to only offer standard features (G0 - G3).
